I’m a self-taught software developer and got my first job in my thirties, after years of relentless, daily, coding practice. Many times I felt lost. I can't complain about the amount of resources available on the internet, but it was very difficult to connect the dots. I felt hopeless many times and second-guessed myself whenever I got stuck. Hence the desire to create this resource to help others who are going through the same.

That will assure the code base is consistent, which is very important for the efficiency of software development teams. "
