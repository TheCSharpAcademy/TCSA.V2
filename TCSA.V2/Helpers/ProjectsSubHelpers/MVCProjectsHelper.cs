Each Razor Pages file found under the Pages directory equates to an endpoint.” There’s a lot of discussion in the .NET world about the pros and cons of Razor Pages vs MVC.

As usual, it’s project-based. The business model should be very similar to our first couple of console Apps, the Habit Tracker, and the Coding Tracker. But in this video I’ll walk you through the project step-by-step. You might consider this “hand-holding”, and it is.
